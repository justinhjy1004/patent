Analyzing Patent Data with Graph Database

## Example Usage
* 8_inventor_similarity.ipynb

## Directory Structure
* Data - miscellaneous data file
* R_Analysis - Quick side analysis in R for data derived from database
* node2vec - SNAP implementation of node2vec (compiled)
* patent_neo4j - implementation of functions for querying, analysis and interacting with data from Database
* load_database - (not properly documented as for now) files used to set up the graph Database

### patent_neo4j
Tried to do it properly. Sadly, I am pretty incompetent in long term planning and winged it way too much. For instance, utils.py and analysis.py have no reason to be separate. Thought it was a good idea but it was not. Don't get to hung up with it. <br />
**Recommendation**: Use based on example usage. It ran on my laptop and hopefully it does on yours!

## Data
Neo4j database
